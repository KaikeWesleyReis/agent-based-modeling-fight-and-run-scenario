## RESULTS
### Frequency Analysis for last three fighters in the battlefield

This graph, show that at the end more *rogues* stay alive! This could be explain because of the *warrior* nature to **NEVER RUN A SINGLE COMBAT!**. As you can see, there is ~33% for *warrior* and ~66% for *rogue* approximately (total of 50 simulations).

### Decay analysis of Warrior X Rogue during the simulation

Here, you can see the same results from the first graph. The number of *warriors* drops dramatically, as * rogues* always run out of combat when they see a *warrior*, implying that the nature of **NEVER RUN A SINGLE COMBAT!** makes the *warriors* kill each other faster and in the end the only one left in combat it becomes invincible! since the rogues will always run from him!

### Winners Attribute Graph - Strength X Agility

This is interesting, this graph shows that in the end the winners were independent of the class itself. These agents somehow bypassed the rules:
- If he was a *warrior*, he had a high agility (close to 5) and a medium strength (close to 5) which made him win any combat against the other *warriors*, even the strongest, because they hit first as han solo ;)
- If he were a *rogue*, he would be more likely to flee a *warrior* and his damage would be higher against *rogues* opponents, that has lower HP.
This result shows how AWESOME is the analysis of agent-based modeling.
